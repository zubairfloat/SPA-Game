            The HASH token is a token uniquely designed for the Hashville game,
            and future games planned for development. HASH tokens can be used to
            purchase important in-game items, and reward players for
            successfully completing harvests. The HASH tokens can be also spent
            on physical products from the Hashville store.{" "}
